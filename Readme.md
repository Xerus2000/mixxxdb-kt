# mixxxdb-kt

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) accessors for the [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) Library Database of [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org), the free and open source cross-platform DJ software.

## mixxx-file-mover

Adjust file locations in the mixxxdb in bulk to retain metadata after reorganising your library. Can be run through [Gradle](https://gradle.org) with `./gradlew run`.

This is a small personal project, and has worked for me for updating locations of Tracks after moving/renaming lots of files, retaining all metadata. But some features are a little wonky and the interface is not self-explanatory, so you should definitely make a backup before trying it.

Feel free to examine and build upon it though :)
